%% Part 1
% The purpose of this report is to investigate the relationship between 3 years CPI (Consumer price index) and unemployment of 45 Walmart stores in different regions.
% The report analyzes the data from different years, the goodness-of-fit of the model and regression line. We found out that there is only a slight relationship between CPI and unemployment,
% as is proved by the linear regression. In Sections 3, we undertook a further exploration of predictive modeling for the relationship between Consumer Price Index (CPI) and unemployment rates.
% Section 3a employed K-fold cross-validation to compare linear and polynomial regression models using all data in 2010, revealing the superiority of the fifth-order polynomial in accuracy.  
% Finally, we delved into 2010-2012 data, shifting from linear models to neural networks in section 3b. The Mean Squared Error analysis favored the neural network, particularly for higher CPI values. 
% These findings collectively underscore the nuanced nature of CPI and unemployment predictions, guiding the adoption of more sophisticated models for enhanced accuracy.

%%
% The data is sourced from Kaggle data site (www.kaggle.com), authored by Rutu Patel, posted two years ago.
% All the following analyses are based on the data given without any change. 
% The data is valid as it is properly formatted, with a complete data set and a large volume. 
% Although it is valid, we could not prove it is reliable. 
% Since Kaggle is a net site where anyone can freely upload data, the accuracy of the data cannot be completely guaranteed. 
% Besides, there is missing data on CPI, which can cause some trouble to the accuracy of the data.
% The data is much more like a simple datasheet provided to test the author%s students as there are requirements and some comments in the data card.
% Due to the uncertainty of the original use of the data, we cannot reach an agreement that the data is of high efficiency.

%%
% The dataset contains 6,435 rows, with each row representing weekly data for a particular store. This dataset is organized into eight columns: Store, Date, Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment. 
% Store: indicates the specific store number. There are a total of 45 stores, numbered from 1 to 45. 
% Date: represents the date when the data was collected. Data points are spaced one week apart, spanning from 05-02-2010 to 26-10-2012 . 
% CPI: knowns as Consumer Price Index, CPI is a statistic that measures the average change in consumer prices for goods and services over time. Variations in the CPI can aid in the monitoring of inflation over time and the comparison of inflation rates between countries. 
% Unemployment: refers to the unemployment rate on a specific date for each store. 
% In our report, we opted not to utilize the columns Holiday_Flag, Temperature, and Fuel_Price. Our primary focus was on understanding the relationship between CPI and unemployment. 
%% Part 2
%%
% To begin, we classified the data by years to pre-process them, which can have a better view of the model. 
% Then we used scatter plots with regression line and correlation coefficients from CPI to unemployment 
% divided by years to determine whether there is a linear relationship between them.

% For the year 2010, the regression line was given by y=âˆ’0.0171x+11.3722 with an R2 value of 0.125. 
% In 2011, the regression equation was y=âˆ’0.0119x+10.137 with an R2 of 0.0628, and for 2012, it was y=âˆ’0.0117x+9.4122 with an R2 of 0.0811. 
% The closer the R2 value is to 1, the stronger the relationship between the variables. Based on our results, there appears to be only 
% a marginal correlation between CPI and unemployment. To delve deeper into this relationship and to identify potential outliers or patterns, 
% it would be beneficial to plot residual graphs.  

%%
% The plot diagram shown illustrates the relationship between CPI and residuals. 
% It can be used to determine if the errors are normally distributed, 
% which is an important assumption in some regression models. 
% On a residual plot, the x-axis typically represents the predicted values,
% and the y-axis represents the residuals.  
% The better the linear fit for the data, the more scatter dots in the residual plot are randomly 
% and uniformly distributed around the center (horizontal axis). In contrast, if the scatter points 
% exhibit patterns or are not evenly distributed, a linear model may not be the best match.
% In the above figure, the scatter points are arranged irregularly, this
% shows that the values of R-square we obtained are reliable.
% However, there is a large gap in the center of the figure, which may be the result of missing data 
% as mentioned before or the unreliability of the data provider. 
% In the broadest sense, the CPI and unemployment rates are often inversely related. 
% In fact, although the results we obtained indicate that the relationship between CPI and unemployment rate is small,
% it does not deny the relationship between them. As for the reason why this result is not obvious, 
% it may be related to other factors (demand, economic policy, etc.).  
% In the third part, we conduct further analysis on the relationship between CPI and unemployment using different prediction models. 

 

%% Part 3(a)
% Further research in machine learning: Comparing linear and 5 order polynomial regression models for predicting CPI versus unemployment in 2010 (all data) using K-fold cross-validation.
%%
% In Section 3a, the objective is to delve deeper into the predictive modeling of the relationship 
% between Consumer Price Index (CPI) and unemployment rate. We employ K-fold cross-validation to rigorously 
% evaluate the performance of both linear and polynomial regression models. The K-fold approach ensures 
% a robust assessment by partitioning the data set into multiple folds, allowing for comprehensive training 
% and testing iterations. By comparing the average R-squared values across folds, this section aims to discern 
% whether the added complexity of polynomial regression yields a significant improvement in prediction accuracy 
% compared to the simpler linear model.

% Read the data

% Preprocess the data

%%
% As shown in codes above, we created a linear regression line model and 
% a five order polynomial model using the K-fold (K=5) cross-validation. 
% The R^2 for the linear regression model are 0.1172, 0.1294, 0.1244, 0.1224 and 0.1288. 
% These values from k-fold cross-validation are similar to the result obtained from a single train-test split, 
% so the linear model's performance is consistent and robust across different subsets of the data. On the other hand, 
% the R^2 for polynomial regression models are 0.3154, 0.2130, 0.3285, 0.2863 and 0.1811. 
% It seems that R^2 in the polynomial model is larger than that in the linear model in general, 
% which implies that the polynomial regression model provides a better fit to the data than the linear model. 
% To further analyse the fitness of prediction between CPI and unemployment rate for these two models, 
% we will calculate the average R^2 for each model over all folds and visualize both models.

% Note: We don t really have interest in the details of  models, only in its prediction accuracy. 
% Thus, we are not writing out the prediction equation here. We simply retain the model objects.
% As shown in the figures above, the average R^2 for the regression line model and 
% five-order polynomial model are 0.1244 and 0.2648 respectively.Visually, the polynomial model 
% also looks better than the regression model. In conclusion, the analysis conducted on the Walmart 
% sales data for the year 2010 using K-fold cross-validation reveals that the Polynomial Regression model,
% with a polynomial order of five, consistently outperforms the Linear Regression model in predicting unemployment based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

% To create a machine learning model, we will be using 2010 and 2011 data
% to train the model in order to predict 2012 values. The success of these
% predictions will then be determined by comparing the predictions to the
% actual 2012 data provided. As shown in Part 2, the linear regression
% models for 2010-2012 data have quite a low r-squared value indicating
% that the relationship between CPI and Unemployment data is alomost not linear
% and a different model should be used to more accurately fit and predict
% Unemployment indices. Neural networks can model complex, non-linear
